These are the projects I've done when I took my beginner course in Flutter and Dart Programming Language. 

hw_1 contains a simple modification to the default flutter app. It shows 2 buttons: one to increment and one to decrement the number on the screen. 

hw_2 is a bmi calculator app. It contains two text boxes for a user to enter their height and weight and moves to a new page that shows their bmi. Also based on the bmi, it lets the user know if they are healthy, underweight, or overweight.

hw_3 is a replication of an IOT app interface. It contains many buttons to control different devices.

weather is an app that uses API calls to find out the weather of the place entered. Provides insights on temperature, rainfall, humidity, and also displays an icon symbolizing the weather of the day. First look at MVC architecture in Flutter
